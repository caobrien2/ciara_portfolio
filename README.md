### About Me
Hello! I am a paraprofessional digital marketer in business with a year of expertise in social media management and content creation.

With skills in event coordination, personnel management, problem-solving, database administration, photography, and caption writing. I am able to create and manage social media platforms for organizations, including our campus library and school clubs, and achieve high engagement from students in response. I am adept at using Excel, Canva, Zoho Social, and RStudio. 

My wide-ranging skill set, commitment to being detail-oriented, and passion for learning makes me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to bake desserts and Irish dance!
